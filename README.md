#Resume Builder

This was my first project in React. I chose to build the entire thing with class components as opposed to functional ones, as I felt like it would give me a good foundation of using State and passing props between components. 

This project really forced me to get comfortable with React and move away from DOM manipulation as I knew it in vanilla JS. 

I had a lot of fun figuring this out but feel comfortable in React now. Future projects I will move to functional components and work to understand lifecycle methods.
